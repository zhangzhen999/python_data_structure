Val Orig :we were just in austin a few days prior , but it was fully booked and couldnt accommodate our last minute change of plans , so we found ourselves at the hampton inn ( practically across the street from our first stay ) . one thing nicer about this hotel is the included breakfast , but the downside is not being able to walk to the shops / restaurants at the domain ( poor us , we had to get ourselves in our car and drive 1 / 2 a mile ! ) . no complaints on the quality of this hotel ! top notch , its just that the first one had a location that couldn't be beat for the price !

Original     :the location is great , we paid extra for ts view . was very UNknown point for all our tours in manhattan , we actually didn't use public transporation , for 7 days of touring manhattan . didn't use any of their restaurants as they are too expensive and did not offer attractive menus at all , while there are so many offering of better and cheaper food outside . the only bad comment is the bad sizes . we reserved for two queens ( one parents and one for the kids ) . problems we got something like two twins ( less than 4 feet wide ) . eventually i had to sleep on the couch ( me any my wife are really small compare to avarage people so i really don't know how it can work out for other couples with kids )

Val Orig :the location was perfect . we were near the muni transportation and the staff was very helpful . the price is high but with walgreens around the corner , we were able to purchase items there to have breakfast in the room for our sleepy children . the beds were very comfortable but it was annoying to have only one sink and the toilet right near it in the bathroom . our room was near the parking garage so we were away from the noise of the street . if you are traveling with children , i would mention it so you give up a view to get the kids to bed . the city has enough views so we were grateful for a quiet room .

Val Orig :i arrived without a lot of time to spare before a dinner meeting due to flight delays and was informed that due to a leak there were no rooms unless i wanted a smoking room that required further deep cleaning . sounded like an excuse and more like they overbooked . had to ask valet to remove suitcase from car , too , by the way . was sent to sister property in an inconvenient location . they paid for 1 night and wanted me to re - pack and come back the next day . my other option when i pushed was to go next door to doubletree but that hotel has no restaurant . i would have appreciated a phone call to save me the time and trouble of going to that hotel for no reason .

Val Orig :dirty , older hotel . we stayed at the sofitel on this trip and it blew the michelangelo away . the michelangelo was tacky and run down . the staff was rude . the bellman complained that our bags were too heavy and asked us to take some of our own bags . another bellman was rude and condescending . only when it was time for a tip did he bother to even make an effort which was pathetic . the tub was dirty . the carpet was stained . not worth it !

Val Orig :we booked at the o'brien on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews and we were thoroughly charmed and pleased . the hotel has a great location - right across the street ( and a parking lot ) from la UNknown and an easy 2 - minute walk to the riverwalk . it was quiet , clean , and the breakfast was excellent for a complimentary spread . we especially enjoyed the friendly staff , who gave us lots of excellent recommendations for restaurants and nightlife . the only downside is that taxis seem to have a hard time finding this hotel - we gave up one night and saw another couple who had waited 45 minutes ! but since you can walk anywhere , this was not a problem for us . highly recommended .

Val Orig :what a pleasant change to stay in a hotel where the owners , with their beautiful dog , are actually present and obviously take good care of the property . you can't beat the location - corner of bush & powell , right by the cable car . the " cozy " queen certainly was that , but who cares . it was quiet , clean , and the hot breakfast was super . if you have a car , parking across the street is a bargain $ 20 . you can't beat that price either . overall , highly recommended .

Val Orig :i share the general opinion that this is an excellent hotel , with a great location , an outstanding staff , and nice amenities . what i appreciated most was the way i was treated when something went wrong . one night , there was a loud noise that could be heard throughout the 18th floor . when i called about it , i was offered a second room on another floor that night . the next day i received a bottle of wine and some candies with a handwritten note of apology . when i checked out , the charges for that night were removed from my bill . in short , the hotel treated me very well , and they even managed to turn a negative into a positive . i thank everyone on the staff and look forward to staying at this excellent hotel again in the near future .

Val Orig :many of the reviews below mention that this property was old and worn down . just wanted to update that they've renovated at least several rooms and i assume eventually all of them . the interior is as nice as i've experienced at a residence inn . granite counter tops , stainless steel fridge , upgraded stove top , flat screens in two rooms . upgraded and very satisfactory workout facilities . based on my one night here , i don't know if they've fixed the sound issue though . i'm in a room that has an adjoining room , and even though the people next door are speaking at reasonable volumes i can pretty much hear them like they're in my living room . so , awesome rooms , just hope that you get a quiet neighbor .

Original     :right off the bat this hotel took a turn for the worst . when wanting to check in we stood at the counter while 1 agent was on the phone . for 15 minutes ! next we tell him we have a reservation and he tries to sell us a room . once the communication barrier was broken we were able to settle in . we threw on our bathing suits , headed down to the pool and . holy cow ! the pool is empty and under construction . we have had these reservations for 3 months now , and not only did i not get a call it was under construction , but when we checked in they didn't mention a thing even though it's 30 feet to their left . that was quite disappointing especially since we spent $ 200 a night being so close to the riverwalk . and it was 100 degrees outside . the breakfast sucked as usual at holiday inns , so all in all a bad experience at a hotel i think so highly of .

Val Orig :contrary to the 3 . 5 star rating that was listed for this property , i am writing to share my displeasure with my recent stay at the crowne plaza columbus north . after driving over 350 miles to spend a weekend in columbus - the last thing that i wanted was a place that smelled like a nursing home , had dingy decor , was noisy , and overall depressing . there was hair in the bed , shower , and in the corners of the bathroom . the wallpaper was peeling off the walls , and i opened my drapes to overlook a swamp . what ? ! i will never stay at a crowne plaza again . when i travel , i look for a refreshing experience where i can enjoy the property and its surroundings . this is certainly not such a place .

Val Orig :i recently traded in some starwood points so my son and i could have " guys weekend " at the inner harbor . the location cannot be beat . the hotel is about 5 minutes away from the baltimore museum side of the harbor , so you arrive next to the main buildings , water taxi , and tour boats . the staff is very friendly and helpful . the room and bathroom were very clean . bed was very comfortable , and room layout was quite good ( easy to walk around , unpack , etc . ) . keep in mind , this is a sheraton , not a westin , w , or st . regis . it is a UNknown hotel . our room was very clean , but there was a noticeable stain on the carpet . the bathtub was fine , but i would not let my son ( he's 6 ) bathe in it . the pool was more of a large hot tub than a pool , though the fitness center looked fairly decent . i would not hesitate to stay here again .

Original     :stayed one night on return leg of family vacation . pick hotel because it was pet friendly , was close to some activities we planned in denver , and with a military discount was not outrageously expensive . the hotel staff was competent , professional and courteous . the room had a great view and was nice , but not exceptional . as expected , the best point about the hotel was its location in the heart of downtown , which made our visit to the denver mint a breeze . the only real drawback was that everything except keeping a pet in the room cost extra , which really isn't all that unusual for this type of hotel , but isn't the norm for the places we normally stay . if you're looking for a hotel in downtown denver , this is a pretty good choice .

Original     :this hotel was very well placed for the attractions along the shore and little italy . it was also not so very far from the gaslamp area but still in a reasonably quiet location . the rooms were well appointed and maintained and the beds extremely comfortable . all the staff were friendly and helpful . breakfast was included , to be eaten next door , and there was plenty of it , with excellent scrambled eggs , though some of the other things on offer were not of the best quality ( for example , the coffee was served from thermos jugs ) . some freshly prepared fruit or yogurt would have been welcome . i think the main problem was having to serve lots of people quickly at the beginning of the day , when they all arrived at once ! however , it was still a very good place to stay and we would choose it again . we didn't try the pool but it looked clean and well maintained .
